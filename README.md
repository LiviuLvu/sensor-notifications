# Push notifications from sensors using python automation  
  
**About this project**  
- Practical, fun way to use Python to solve problems in home automation.  
- Needed a reliable way to monitor and get alerts based on sensors i use around the house.

**Why not Homeassistant?**  
- It's inconvenient to use dedicated device only for it Homeassistant.  
- Inside Proxmox container, it is difficult to pair sensors, displays duplicates, and can brake after updates.

## Components needed for my Proxmox setup:  
  
### 1 Zigbee antenna USB  
Already have a usb from Conbee II which works great.  
Check its recognized and available in Proxmox:  
List all usb devices and search for your specific device:  
```
ls /dev/serial/by-id/ 
```
  
### 2 MQTT message broker  
What it is:  
central server for the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol, lightweight publish-subscribe protocol designed for IOT devices limited in power and low bandwith.  

Selected option: **Mosquito**  
[https://mosquitto.org/](https://mosquitto.org/)  
  Proxmox LXC helper: [https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=mqtt](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=mqtt)  
  Chose this one because it was available in Proxmox helpers and required less resource than the alternative EMQX.  
**Post install steps:**

### 3 MQTT client  
What it is:  
software that enables connection to a MQTT broker.  

Selected software: **zigbee2mqtt**  
[https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/)   
  Docker compose [https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/installation/02_docker.html](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/installation/02_docker.html)  
  Proxmox LXC helper: [https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=zigbee2mqtt](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=zigbee2mqtt)  
  This was the only zigbee - mqtt software available in proxmox helpers.  
**Post install steps:**

### 4 Push notification option  
Options:  
**Pushover:** Small multiplaform app, seems convenient  
[https://pushover.net/](https://pushover.net/)   
Telegram: Never used, not sure its worth creating account  
Email: Delayed, might miss something urgent like a pipe leak

### Debugging  
Check Logs: journalctl -u zigbee2mqtt -n 50 --no-pager  
Check config yaml settings:  
[https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/configuration/all-settings.html?utm_source=copilot.com#advanced](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/configuration/all-settings.html?utm_source=copilot.com#advanced)  
  
**Zigbee2mqtt service issues installing and starting**  
 - specified static ip. It was not connecting to Opnsense DHCP  
 - accidentaly activated ssh, then had to deactivate it manually from inside container  
 - conbee II usb was used in another container. I had HomeAssistant running there  
 - frontend host set to internal "Localhost" instead of 0.0.0.0  
 - permit_join was set to false. Allows devices to join network  
 - reject_unauthorized was set to true, but there is not SSL cert setup yet  
 - wrong serial port. Did not put the full path  
  
To look out for:  
 - at least one sensor drains the battery too fast (4 days). zigbee2mqtt setup seems ok  
 - pushover api might reduce/drop free quota

Connecting to MQTT...
Connected to MQTT with result code: Success

```
  
**Checklist to validate minimal setup:**  
✓ Install client  
✓ install broker  
✓ pair sensor to zigbee2mqtt, check state  
✓ write script and test notification in dev container  
✓ containerize script in python based image  
✓ test script in container on macos  
✓ install push notification app, get api key  
✓ use script to push received message to phone  

Optional  
. deploy script on Proxmox Dokploy container via ghrc  
. send email fallback  
. pair homeassistant to zigbee
